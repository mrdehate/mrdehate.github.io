### Updates
This is very close to the previous recipe!
- Copy/pasted 3 eggs from the last recipe, lol. That mistake carries forward!
- Removed PB2. Didn't get any PB joy from it last time.
- Used mini chips because I didn't have any dark chips on hand.

## Review
It's been a while since the last batch, so I've kinda lost the comparison here. Generally though they are fluffy and chocolatey, which is great. Still a little...beany-y though.

Some notes:
- Tasted literally no chips here. Small chips don't seem like the right answer.
- Still liking the 9x13 pan. Seems like the right kind of fluffy, and the extra servings are rad.
- Still got a weird taste. Not sure if I forgot what these tasted like, or it's the Stevia, or something else. All in all still enjoyable.

## Next Steps
* Was just reading about aquafaba, and how you can use it to replace a whole egg. This is notably different from how I used it previously, whipped. Need to try this next time.
* Still should try a scoop of real peanut butter. Maybe with less mini chips it would work out.
* I really want to try these funfetti chips in this. Next time!
