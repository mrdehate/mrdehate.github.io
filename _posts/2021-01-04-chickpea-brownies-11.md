### Updates
This is very close to the previous recipe!

- Removed PB2. Didn't get any PB joy from it last time.

## Review

Some notes:


## Next Steps
* Was just reading about aquafaba, and how you can use it to replace a whole egg. This is notably different from how I used it previously, whipped. Need to try this next time.
* Still should try a scoop of real peanut butter. Maybe with less mini chips it would work out.
* I really want to try these funfetti chips in this. Next time!
