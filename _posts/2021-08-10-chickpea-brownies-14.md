# Chickpea Brownies, v14 - Toffee
## Goals
1. Now that we have zero point sweetener, let's up the quantity to see what happens
2. Toffee bits. Since I can never add enough chips to make them actually tastable, let's see if those add at least some crunch if not any flavor.

## Ingredients

- Canned chickpeas, reduced sodium | 2x 15oz can, drained _and peeled_
- Table salt | 1 tsp
- Baking powder | 1 tsp
- Baking soda | 1 tsp
- Vanilla extract | 1 tsp
- [Cook's Pure Maple Extract](https://amzn.to/2LiRs8L) | 1 tsp
- [Zensweet monkfruit sweetener](https://amzn.to/3f3s8j2) | 1/2 cup
- Espresso powder | 1 tbsp
- Eggs | 4 whole
- Applesauce, unsweetened | 1 cup
- Toll House Cocoa Powder | 4 tbsp (1 pt)
- Heath Toffee Bits, Bit O' Brickle (the non-chocolate kind) | 7 tbsp (28pts)

### Updates
- Sweetener - Monkfruit, turns out, is 0 points - so upped this to 3/4 cup, which is inching closer to what a standard brownie recipe would be
- Cocoa powder - Got more cocoa powder, so switched back to Toll House
- Eggs - Went back to all real eggs
- Chips - Heath toffee bits rather than the chocolate morsels

## Review

Some notes:
* The toffee bits completely disappeared. It was actually impressive, I was looking hard and could not locate a single one.
* Improved texture over the last batch; maybe eggs, maybe longer baking time.
