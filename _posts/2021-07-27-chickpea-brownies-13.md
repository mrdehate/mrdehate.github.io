# Chickpea Brownies, v13 - Monkfruit
## Goals
1. I recently learned about monkfruit, and that it comes in a 1:1 for sugar form. Also, it's 0 points for as much as you can eat, unlike Splenda, Stevia, or obviously real sugar. Let's see if this impacts our ongoing slightly-off taste.
2. Another theory is about the chickpea skins. I've always used them straight out of the can; maybe the skins impact the taste too?

## Ingredients

- Canned chickpeas, reduced sodium | 2x 15oz can, drained _and peeled_
- Table salt | 1 tsp
- Baking powder | 1 tsp
- Baking soda | 1 tsp
- Vanilla extract | 1 tsp
- [Cook's Pure Maple Extract](https://amzn.to/2LiRs8L) | 1 tsp
- [Zensweet monkfruit sweetener](https://amzn.to/3f3s8j2) | 1/2 cup
- Espresso powder | 1 tbsp
- Egg beaters | 1 cup (4 eggs' worth)
- Applesauce, unsweetened | 1 cup
- Toll House Cocoa Powder | 2 tbsp
- Honduran Cocoa Powder | 2 tbsp (2pts)
- Hershey's Sea Salt Caramel Chips | 6 tbsp (26pts)

### Updates
- No aquafaba - Part of this was laziness, part of it is also questioning if it's actually helpful, or if it's contributing to the flavor negatively.
- Swapped sweetener - Monkfruit, turns out, is 0 points for an infinite amount! So I changed sweetner and increased to 1/2 cup.
- Cocoa powder - Ran out of the Toll House cocoa powder. The Honduran stuff is good but not free, so had to drop the chips a tiny bit. 
- Peeled chickpeas - Never peeled the chickpeas before. It's a pain, confirmed.
- Egg beaters - Swapped extra egg beaters in the kitchen for the real-eggs formerly used. No change in points, all free.
- Chips - Wanted to use up these sea salt caramel chips; we'll see if these are any more notable than any of the other chips I've tried.

## Review

Some notes:
* I think I've had a recipe copy/paste error that has persisted for many iterations of this recipe, stemming back to when I doubled the size into a 9x13 pan. 1/2 cup is still not a lot of sweetener. Well, good news at least, the monkfruit can be scaled to whatever I can afford, so that's something.
* 35 minutes, maybe not enough for these. Pretty squishy.
* Flavor is excellent though. Less of a weird aftertaste for sure.

## Next Steps
Generally I think we need to just tweak a few variables on this
* Cook longer
* Jump up to maybe 3/4 cup of monkfruit
* Probably should go back to using real eggs here; this likely impacted the texture
