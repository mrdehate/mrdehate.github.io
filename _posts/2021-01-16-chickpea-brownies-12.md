## Ingredients

- Canned chickpeas | 2x 15oz can, drained
- Table salt | 1 tsp
- Baking powder | 1 tsp
- Baking soda | 1 tsp
- Vanilla extract | 1 tsp
- [Cook's Pure Maple Extract](https://amzn.to/2LiRs8L) | 1 tsp
- Splenda Granulated sweetener | 6 tbsp
- Espresso powder | 1 tbsp
- Eggs | 2 whole
- Aquafaba, lightly whipped | 6 tbsp
- Applesauce, unsweetened | 1 cup
- Toll House Cocoa Powder | 4 tbsp
- Hershey's Funfetti Chips | 5 tbsp
- Jif Peanut Butter | 2 tbsp

### Updates
- Subbed out half of the eggs with aquafaba. Apparently aquafaba in substitute for eggs only needs light whipping, unlike a full-on merengue. Was able to make it in the milk frother, which was great!
- Added 2 tbsp of peanut butter
- Subbed in funfetti chips. They are vanilla cake flavored, which is amazing. Had to reduce quantity though for supporting peanut butter.
- Chickpeas were not reduced sodium. Meijer was out, what can you do.
