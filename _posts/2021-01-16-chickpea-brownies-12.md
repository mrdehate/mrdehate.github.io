## Goals
1. Been wanting to try real peanut butter again
2. Intrigued by aquafaba, let's give that another go

## Ingredients

- Canned chickpeas | 2x 15oz can, drained
- Table salt | 1 tsp
- Baking powder | 1 tsp
- Baking soda | 1 tsp
- Vanilla extract | 1 tsp
- [Cook's Pure Maple Extract](https://amzn.to/2LiRs8L) | 1 tsp
- Stevia Granulated sweetener | 6 tbsp
- Espresso powder | 1 tbsp
- Eggs | 2 whole
- Aquafaba, lightly whipped | 6 tbsp
- Applesauce, unsweetened | 1 cup
- Toll House Cocoa Powder | 4 tbsp
- Hershey's Funfetti Chips | 5 tbsp
- Jif Peanut Butter | 2 tbsp

### Updates
- Subbed out half of the eggs with aquafaba. Apparently aquafaba in substitute for eggs only needs light whipping, unlike a full-on merengue. Was able to make it in the milk frother, which was great!
- Added 2 tbsp of peanut butter
- Subbed in funfetti chips. They are vanilla cake flavored, which is amazing. Had to reduce quantity though for supporting peanut butter.
- Chickpeas were not reduced sodium. Meijer was out, what can you do.

## Review
The core here, is a really excellent brownie. Not sure the changes I made were all successful though.

Some notes:
* Peanut butter is again, not notable. 
* Chips, also not notable, unless you're really trying.
* Texture on these was excellent. Not sure if it's a aquafaba thing, or just I finally found the right time to cook these, or what. Cakey, but fudgey. Excellent.
* The Stevia, I don't know that I taste a difference from the Splenda. It's definitely got an oddball flavor a bit, though I'm blaming the chickpeas.

## Next Steps
* Aquafaba was an interesting addition last time. Might want to tweak that; curious what happens with all aquafaba.
* Peanut butter might be a lost cause here, unless I go back to the small pan anyway. 
* The chip thing is bumming me out. I might try putting them on top next time, and not mixed in? I also might have been accidentally chopping them a little bit in the food processor. Maybe. :)
