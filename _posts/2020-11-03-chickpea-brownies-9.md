# Chickpea Brownies, v9 - Double Dose
## Goals
1. A long struggle I've had is how to get fluffier brownies. Upon inspection of the recipe, it seems possible to double it while not really changing the point value. So let's do it!

## Ingredients

- Canned chickpeas, reduced sodium | 2x 15oz can, drained
- Table salt | 1 tsp
- Baking powder | 1 tsp
- Baking soda | 1 tsp
- Vanilla extract | 1 tsp
- Maple extract | 1 tsp
> Vanilla extract turns into a point at 2tsp, so cheating a bit (a lot) by bringing maple back instead
- Hershey's Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate Chips | 4 1/2 tbsp
> Meijer was out of the Toll House dark chocolate chips. These are a little smaller in size, which, might or might not be good?
- Splenda Granulated sweetener | 6 tbsp
- Espresso powder | 1 tbsp
> Last recipe was pretty heavy on espresso so keeping this the same
- Eggs | 4 whole
- Applesauce, unsweetened | 1 cup
- Toll House Cocoa Powder | 4 tbsp
> The Honduran stuff had a bunch more fat in it. Was probably tastier, but subbed out for point savings.

## Review
So these were tall enough that I couldn't fit them into the 8x8 foil pans. Even with the extra dishes though these are excellent. Probably my favorite, though there's just a lot more there to taste.
Some notes:
* Way more beefy than any other brownie. With cool whip (or caramel/etc topping), the extra size really makes them taste, just more.
* Didn't hold together _super_ well; a bit crumbly and dry. 
* Not adding more chips is tough. Especially these smaller ones, they got lost a bit.
* Do I secretly taste the extracts? Because I sure don't think I do, but I keep adding them, lol.
* Would eat again.

## Next Steps
* I (still) miss the peanut butter. Especially with these double guys, where it's just kinda generally chocolatey, and could use that extra kick.
* I really like the tall size. Would like to do more of this.
* Did I secretly overbake these? I don't think so, but maybe? Might want to test these sooner.
