# Chickpea Brownies, v15 - White Bean
## Goals
1. New beans! What happens if we swap out one of the cans of chickpeas with a different, more boring bean? 
2. Dark chocolate chips. Wanting to try this again to see if these  bigger chips fully melt or not.

## Ingredients

- Canned chickpeas | 1x 15oz can, drained _and peeled_
- Canned cannellini (white kidney) beans | 1x 15oz can, drained
- Table salt | 1 tsp
- Baking powder | 1 tsp
- Baking soda | 1 tsp
- Vanilla extract | 1 tsp

### Updates
- Beans - Swapped out one of the chickpeas for white kidney beans. Also, both of these are full-sodium.
- Sweetener - 3/4 cup last time, and I started to get a bit of a weird aftertaste. Backing this down to 2/3 cup.
- Chips - Dark chocolate morsels this time; these are slightly bigger in size than standard chips.
