# Chickpea Brownies, v8 - Reboot
## Goals
1. Having recently learned that eggs and applesauce are 0 point foods on the WW purple plan, I feel like I've been playing on hard mode all this time. Subbing in these standard brownie ingredients.
2. I realized it's the PB2 that has given past batches a weird flavor. Removing this (sigh).

## Ingredients
Unchanged
- Canned chickpeas, reduced sodium | 15oz can, drained
- Table salt | 1/2 tsp
- Baking powder | 1/2 tsp
- Baking soda | 1/2 tsp
- Vanilla extract | 1 tsp
- Toll House Dark Chocolate chips | 4 1/2 tbsp
- Splenda Granulated sweetener | 6 tbsp

New/Changed
- Espresso powder | 1 tbsp
> Replaces ground coffee - using real espresso powder and increasing qty a tiny bit
- Eggs | 2 whole
> New - seems legit
- Applesauce, unsweetened | 1/2 cup
